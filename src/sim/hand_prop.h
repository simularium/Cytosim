     The binding to a fiber is allowed only if the keys of the Hand and Fiber match.
     The test uses a BITWISE-AND of the two keys:

             allowed = true;
         else
             allowed = false;

     Thus, with `binding_key==0' attachment is completely disabled, and in general
     one needs to look at the bit-pattern of the number in base 2. For example
     `1` can bind to `3` but not to `2`.

     This defines a detachment opportunity that is proportional to time.
     Kramers theory specifies that the detachment rate depends on the force
     in the link:
     
         RATE = unbinding_rate * exp( FORCE / unbinding_force )
     
     where FORCE is the norm of the tension in the link holding the Hand,
     and `unbinding_rate' and `unbinding_force' are two parameters.
     By setting `unbinding_force=inf', unbinding is made independent of load.
