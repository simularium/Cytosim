/// A Fiber with discrete growth and dynamic instability at the PLUS_END
/**

 This implements the microtubule dynamic instability model proposed by
 Brun, Rupp et al. with a 'hard-coded' coupling parameter N=2.
 
 Assembly and disassembly follow discrete steps of size `prop->unit_length`.
 The model keeps track of the discrete state of the two terminal units of tubulin.
 This leads to 4 different states, which are mapped to [STATE_GREEN, STATE_RED].
 
 
 The growth speed is reduced under antagonistic force by an exponential factor:\n

 ...and this increases the catastrophe rate:\n

 The predicted mean time until catastrophe is approximately

     growing_rate = growing_speed / unit_length
     real ctime = growing_rate / ( 3 * hydrolysis_rate * hydrolysis_rate );
 
 The implemented model includes off-rate in the assembly state, as described in:\n

 This is not implemented:
 - the MINUS_END is not dynamic,
 - rescues are not included.
 .
 
 See the @ref DynamicFiberPar.

 // @todo DynamicFiber detach_rate should depend on the state of the subunit
 // @todo DynamicFiber should keep the entire state vector of the subunits

 Note: A Gillespie simulation method is used.
 This class is not fully tested (17. Feb 2011).
