     The `time_step` is the amount of time between two consecutive simulation states.
     It controls the precision of the simulation, at the expense of computation.\n
     We expect that the numerical result will converge to the true mathematical solution
     of the equations when `time_step` becomes infinitely small, but we do not necessarily 
     know how fast this convergence will be. Thus it is not usually possible to 
     calculate the precision as a function of the `time_step`.\n
     To check that `time_step` is appropriate for a particular problem, one should 
     always run several simulations where `time_step` is varied systematically.
     
     Useful rules:
     - A smaller time step is always preferable, provided that the time to run the simulation
     remains acceptable,
     - You should always check that the results of two simulations with <em>time_step=h</em>\
     and <em>time_step=h/2</em> are identical. If this is not the case, then `h`\
     is most likely not an appropriate value for `time_step`,
     - If some reaction in the simulation occures with a rate R, then `time_step`\
     should be such that <em>time_step * R << 1</em>. In practice `time_step * R` should not be higher than 0.2.

     Note that non-linear effects are not taken into account in Cytosim. Hydrodynamic effects are also neglected, such that the drag coefficient of a collection of objects is simply the sum of the individual drag coefficients. However, an `effective` viscosity can be set for each object class, and with this option, it is possible to adjust the drag coefficient of the collection to a realistic value.

     to try the different accepted values of `precondition`:
     - 0 : do not use preconditionning
     - 1 : use a block preconditionner
     .
     
     With `precondition = 1`, Cytosim calculates a matrix (the preconditionner)
     that is approximately equal to the inverse of the matrix that characterize the
     dynamical system. Using this preconditionner can reduce the number of iterations
     needed to converge to a solution, resulting in a potential overall speedup.
     However, calculating the preconditionner itself is costly, and performing an
     iteration with preconditionning is also more expensive than without.
     Hence there is a complex tradeoff, and the performance will vary.
     In some cases, using `precondition=1` can degrade preformance, 
     in particular if some objects have many vertices.
     
     If there is only one filament in the system, `precondition=0` should perform best.
     With many filaments, trying `precondition = [0, 1]' is the recommended strategy.

     `steric_max_range` defines the minimum size of the cells in the grid.
     A finer grid reduces false positives, but increases the amount of memory occupied by the grid,
     and the number calculations that are necessary to maintain and clear the grid.
     
     Thus optimal performance is usually obtained for an intermediate value of `steric_max_range`.
     However `steric_max_range` must remain greater than the maximum interaction distance,
     otherwise some interacting pairs will be missed. 
     Experimentation is usually necessary to find the best value.
     
     The maximum distance at which an object may interact with a sibling is its diameter.
     Generally, `steric_max_range` should be greater or equal to the sum of the radiuses,
     of any two object that may interact.
     In the case of fiber, the `interaction-radius` is a combination of the segmentation,
     and the radius: sqrt( (4/3*segmentation)^2 + 4*radius^2 )
