     The bending elasticity modulus `rigidity` has units of pN * um^2,
     and is related to the persitence length `Lp` via the Boltzman constant and
     absolute temperature (kT = k_B * T):
    
         rigidity = Lp * kT
     
     Many measurments have been made and they agree somewhat:\n

     `segmentation` is a distance, which affects the precision by which the

     used for a filament of length `L` is the integer `N` that minimizes:

         fabs( L / N - segmentation )
     
     As a rule of thumb, segmentation should scale with rigidity, depending on 
     the expected magnitude of the forces experienced by the filament:

         segmentation = sqrt(rigidity/force)
         force ~ rigidity / segmentation^2
     
     Generally, a simulation should not be trusted if any filament contains kinks
     (i.e. if the angle between consecutive segments is greater then 45 degrees).
     In that case, the simulation should be redone with a segmentation divided by 2,
     and the segmentation should be reduced until kinks do not appear.
