/// A Hand that move with discrete steps of fixed size along a Fiber
/**
 The Walker moves like a Motor, but it makes discrete jumps along the fiber.
 
 The size of the step size is set by @ref DigitPar digit:step_size.
 The number of steps in one `time_step` is a stochastic integer  
 with a Poisson distribution.
 
 As defined in Hand, detachment increases exponentially with force.

 The Digit will use the Lattice and will not step into an occupied site.
 
 See Examples and the @ref WalkerPar.

 Note: Conventional kinesin can make backward steps under heavy load:\n

 According to this work, a real kinesin stalls because the probability of making
 a forward step, which is decreased by load, becomes equal to the probability of
 making a backward step.

 With antagonistic force however, the Walker will stall in a immobile configuration,
 because it can only make forward steps, wereas a stalled kinesin keeps moving
 back-and-forth over a few lattice sites.
 Thus one should be careful when using Walker to model Kinesin.
