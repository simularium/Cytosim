Authors: XXX (2019)

### Objective

This tutorial will teach you how to simulate the movements of a nucleus inside an elongated cylindrical cell.

The configuration is directly taken from:

>R. Gibeaux, A. Z. Politi, P. Philippsen and F. Nédélec.  
>Molecular Biolology of the Cell (2017).

We will start with [this configuration file](data/ashbya.cym).
Let's see what this files contains.
